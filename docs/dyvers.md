## 1. 🧭 Description

Once a proud rival to Greyhawk, **Dyvers** now bears the marks of decline and stubborn independence. Though its influence has waned since ceding territory to Furyondy, it remains a **key mercantile and naval port** on the Nyr Dyv. Its chaotic nature, free-spirited governance, and vibrant markets still attract traders, mercenaries, pirates, and adventurers unwilling to bow to the order of Greyhawk or the doctrine of Veluna.

The city is messy, vibrant, opportunistic — and always one misstep away from a riot. Its streets are filled with color, tension, and coin.

## 4. 🧱 Social Structure

Dyvers has **no nobility in name**, but gold and influence form de facto castes. Power is distributed loosely among wealthy merchant families, guild leaders, and corrupt administrators.

- **Upper Tier:** Wealthy merchants, shipwrights, illicit trade kings, old money
    
- **Middle Tier:** Guild artisans, mages, captains, former adventurers
    
- **Lower Tier:** Dockhands, barge-pullers, criminals, sailors, servants
    
- **Hidden Tier:** Cults, exiled mages, spy cells from Greyhawk and Furyondy
    

The city encourages upward mobility — but only the brutal survive the climb.
