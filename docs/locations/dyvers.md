## 1.  Description

Once a proud rival to Greyhawk, **Dyvers** now bears the marks of decline and stubborn independence. Though its influence has waned since ceding territory to Furyondy, it remains a **key mercantile and naval port** on the Nyr Dyv. Its chaotic nature, free-spirited governance, and vibrant markets still attract traders, mercenaries, pirates, and adventurers unwilling to bow to the order of Greyhawk or the doctrine of Veluna.

The city is messy, vibrant, opportunistic  and always one misstep away from a riot. Its streets are filled with color, tension, and coin.
