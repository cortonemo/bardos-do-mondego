##  Description

Dorakaa is a blight upon the Flanaess  a city raised in hate, ruled by fear, and steeped in blood. Once a minor frontier settlement, it was reshaped into a nightmarish capital by the demigod Iuz. Behind its basalt-black walls, infernal engines grind, necromancers command armies of the dead, and devils walk openly in the streets.

It is both the **heart of a theocracy** and the **seat of tyranny**, where loyalty is mandatory, suspicion is survival, and power flows from Iuzs throne  or his whims.
