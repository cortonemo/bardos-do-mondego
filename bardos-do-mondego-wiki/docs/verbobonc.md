## 1. 🧭 Description

**Verbobonc** is a fortified riverside city that balances **Velunan order**, **rural autonomy**, and **arcane vigilance**. Known for its connection to legendary adventuring parties, it played a central role in the resistance against the Temple of Elemental Evil. Today, it remains a **hub for heroic tradition**, druidic guardianship, and quiet political maneuvering between Veluna, Furyondy, and Greyhawk.
